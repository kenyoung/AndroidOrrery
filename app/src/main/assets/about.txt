About Orrery

This program produces a display inspired by the "Sky Gazer's Almanac" published by Sky and Telescope (S&T) every January. It is significantly different than that almanac though because:

1) It is customized to your location and time

2) It is significantly simplified to accomodate the small space available on a cell phone display. Many items displayed on the S&T graphic are omitted.

3) Time increases in the upward direction on the display, rather than downward as on the S&T graphic.

4) The horizontal axis is standard time, not local solar time.

5) Astronomical twilight is shown.

6) Moon phases are shown to the right of the sunrise line, rather than within the plot.

7) Labelling is done using planet symbols.
