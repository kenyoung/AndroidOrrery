        <h1>Orrery App Help</h1>

        <div class="card">
            <p>
                This app displays information about the positions of the Sun and planets, both in the sky and relative
                to each other. The app can produce nine displays, which can be selected using the three-dot menu in
                the upper right corner.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Planet Transits</h2>
        <p>
            The default display is the Planet Transits display, which shows the times of sunset and sunrise and twilight
            as well as the rising, transit, and setting times of the planets. The times of the four major Moon phases,
            new, 1<sup>st</sup> quarter, full, and last quarter are also shown. The display has two time axes. The vertical
            axis is time running from the current time (at the display’s bottom) upwards through the next year (at the
            display’s top).
        </p>
        <p>
            The horizontal axis is the standard time (never daylight saving time) for a given day. The curved white line
            on the left side shows the time of sunset. The blue region to the left of that line shows the time of evening
            twilight. The white curve on the right-hand side shows the time of sunrise, with morning twilight shown to its
            left in blue, and the phase of the Moon shown to the right of the curve. The latitude, longitude, Universal Time,
            and Local Sidereal Time are shown above the graphic plot.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the current time and the phone’s location are used to produce the display, but user-defined values
            can be entered using dialog boxes selectable in the three-dot menu. Horizontal gray lines are drawn between sunset
            and sunrise for day 1 of each month. If the current time is between sunset and sunrise, it is shown as a vertical
            gray line running through all displayed days.
        </p>
        <p>
            The times of rising, transit, and setting are plotted between the sunset and sunrise curves. The colors used are:
            Mercury: gray, Venus: white, Mars: red, Jupiter: orange, Saturn: yellow, Uranus: blue-green, and Neptune: blue.
            The transit lines are bright, and the rising and setting lines are dimmer. Planet symbols are shown near the lines,
            with r, t, and s subscripts for rise, transit, and set.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lines are only plotted for times between sunset and sunrise, so for most locations no transit lines for Mercury
            or Venus are plotted, and for those planets the rise and set lines are bright.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Planet Elevations</h2>
        <p>
	  This display shows the elevation above the horizon for the Sun, Moon and planets. The UT is listed across the top, and the LST is listed across the bottom. Theo vertical lines show the time of sunset (left) and sunrise (right), along with blue shading for twilight. A horizontal line for each object shows the period of time during which the object is above the horizon. Tick marks on those lines show the elevation at 20 degree intervals, and a tick mark at the line's center shows the object's elevation at transit. A vertical line (gray before sunset, green after sunset) shows the current time, and during the time between sunset and sunrise the names of the objects that are currently visible are shown in green.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Planet Compass</h2>
        <p>
	  This display shows the current azimuth and elevation of the Sun, Moon ad planets.  The full circle on the upper right shows the azimuth of each object. Objects above the horizon are shown in white, and objects below the horizon are red. The lengths of the lines connecting the circle to the object's symbol are meaningless - different lengths are used merely to prevent the symbols from overlapping. The semicircle on the upper left shows the current elevation for each object.
	</p>
	<p>
	 Below the graphic figures is a table of the hour angle and rising, transit and setting times for all the plotted objects.  Objects above the horizon are named with green text, and red otherwise. The time of the next event for each object is shown in white, and the other events are shown in gray.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Planet Phenomena</h2>
        <p>
	  The planet phenomena page shows a table with the date and hour of certain events related to a planet's position in the sky. The table ha two columns, The left column shows the time of the most recent occurance of the phenomenon, and the right column show when the phenomenon will next occur.
	</p>
	<p>
	For the inferior planets (Mercury and Venus) the dates and hour of inferior confunction (when the object is directly in between the Sun and the Earth), maximum western elongation (from the Sun, with the anglular separation), superior conjunction (when the object is directly behind the Sun as seen from Earth) and maximum eastern elongation (with the angular separation) are shown. The maximum elongation times shown can be in error by up to three hours. These planets (especially Mercury)  are most easily seen near greatest elongation.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For the superior planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) the times of conjunction (when the Sun is between and planet and the Earth) and opposition (when the Earth is between the Sun and the planet) are listed.  The planet is usually impossible to see near conjuntion, and best seen near opposition.
	</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Moon Calendar</h2>
        <p>
	  The Moon Calendar shows the phase of the Moon for every day within a 21 month interval, centered on the current month.
	  You can swipe right or left to move forward or backward in time. Blue Moons (the second Full Moon in a calendar month) are shown in cyan.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A yellow square is drawn around the current phase. All Full Moons are circled in red. Light gray shading is applied to the unilluminated portion of the Moon figure if earthshine might be visible. New Moons are shown in dark gray.
        </p>
        <hr>
	<h2> Analemma</h2>
	<p>
	  The Analemma is a plot of the
altitude of the Sun at transit, versus the Equation of Time for each
day of the year. Its primary purpose is to confuse students looking
at old globes. The value for the current time is shown with a dot
marked “Now”.
	</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Schematic Orrery</h2>
        <p>
            The schematic Orrery page shows the current position of the planets (and our Moon) relative to the Sun, as seen
            from above the Sun’s north pole, with the top of the display oriented towards the Vernal Equinox. Nothing is to
            scale, and the orbits are shown as ellipses. This display gives a rough idea of where solar system objects are at
            the moment. Buttons at the bottom of the page allow the planetary motions to be animated over a period of 1, 10,
            or 100 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The longer periods are animated more rapidly, so that all three animations run for about the same elapsed time.
            While animations are running, they can be stopped by pressing the STOP button. Pressing the Reset button returns
            the display to the initial time.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>To-scale Orrery</h2>
        <p>
            The To-scale Orrery display is like the Schematic Orrery, except that the planet orbits are shown, to scale, as
            properly oriented ellipses with the Sun at one focus. Because the orbits of the inner planets are so small relative
            to Neptune’s orbit, pinch-to-zoom must be used to see all of the orbits distinctly. Halley's Comet is included, because it has an interesting highly eccentric retrograde orbit.
        </p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Astronomical Times</h2>
	<p>
	  The Astronomical Times page displays several different times useful in astronomy:<br>
	  <b>JD</b>: This is the Julian
Day, a count of the number of days since January 1, 4713 BC. This
timescale is used to assign unambiguous dates to astronomical events
throughout recorded history, so that we don’t have to worry about
what particular calendar was used at some date in the past. One oddity is that
midnight on the scale occurs at noon Greenwich Mean
Time, presumably because European astronomers didn’t want the day
	  to change in the middle of a night’s observations.<br>
	  <b>MJD:</b> JD-2400000.5<br>
	  <b>UT:</b> The Universal Time<br>
	  <b>Eq. of Time:</b> The Equation of Time, the difference between apparent time (sundialtime) and mean time. Mean Time = Apparent Time – Eq. Of Time<br>
	  <b>Eq. of Equinoxes:</b> The Equation of the Equinoxes, The difference between the apparent sidereal time and the mean sidereal time. AST = MST + EqEq<<br>
																				  <b>Mean Solar:</b> The local
																				  time using a “mean fictitious Sun” that moves in such a way as to produce days of exactly equal length.<br>
																				  <b>App. Solar:</b> The local time using the real Sun.<br>
																				  <b>Mean LST:</b> The Local Sidereal Time using uniform length days.<br>
																				  <b>App. LST:</b> The Apparent Sidereal Time<br>
	</p>
