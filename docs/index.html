        <h1>Orrery App Help</h1>

        <div class="card">
            <p>
                This app displays information about the positions of the Sun and planets, both in the sky and relative
                to each other. The app can produce three displays, which can be selected using the three-dot menu in
                the upper right corner.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Planet Transits Display</h2>
        <p>
            The default display is the Planet Transits display, which shows the times of sunset and sunrise and twilight
            as well as the rising, transit, and setting times of the planets. The times of the four major Moon phases,
            new, 1<sup>st</sup> quarter, full, and last quarter are also shown. The display has two time axes. The vertical
            axis is time running from the current time (at the display’s bottom) upwards through the next year (at the
            display’s top).
        </p>
        <p>
            The horizontal axis is the standard time (never daylight saving time) for a given day. The curved white line
            on the left side shows the time of sunset. The blue region to the left of that line shows the time of evening
            twilight. The white curve on the right-hand side shows the time of sunrise, with morning twilight shown to its
            left in blue, and the phase of the Moon shown to the right of the curve. The latitude, longitude, Universal Time,
            and Local Sidereal Time are shown above the graphic plot.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the current time and the phone’s location are used to produce the display, but user-defined values
            can be entered using dialog boxes selectable in the three-dot menu. Horizontal gray lines are drawn between sunset
            and sunrise for day 1 of each month. If the current time is between sunset and sunrise, it is shown as a vertical
            gray line running through all displayed days.
        </p>
        <p>
            The times of rising, transit, and setting are plotted between the sunset and sunrise curves. The colors used are:
            Mercury: gray, Venus: white, Mars: red, Jupiter: orange, Saturn: yellow, Uranus: blue-green, and Neptune: blue.
            The transit lines are bright, and the rising and setting lines are dimmer. Planet symbols are shown near the lines,
            with r, t, and s subscripts for rise, transit, and set.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lines are only plotted for times between sunset and sunrise, so for most locations no transit lines for Mercury
            or Venus are plotted, and for those planets the rise and set lines are bright.
        </p>

        <h2>Schematic Orrery</h2>
        <p>
            The schematic Orrery page shows the current position of the planets (and our Moon) relative to the Sun, as seen
            from above the Sun’s north pole, with the top of the display oriented towards the Vernal Equinox. Nothing is to
            scale, and the orbits are shown as ellipses. This display gives a rough idea of where solar system objects are at
            the moment. Buttons at the bottom of the page allow the planetary motions to be animated over a period of 1, 10,
            or 100 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The longer periods are animated more rapidly, so that all three animations run for about the same elapsed time.
            While animations are running, they can be stopped by pressing the STOP button. Pressing the Reset button returns
            the display to the initial time.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>To-scale Orrery</h2>
        <p>
            The To-scale Orrery display is like the Schematic Orrery, except that the planet orbits are shown, to scale, as
            properly oriented ellipses with the Sun at one focus. Because the orbits of the inner planets are so small relative
            to Neptune’s orbit, pinch-to-zoom must be used to see all of the orbits distinctly.
