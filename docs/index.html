            <p>
                This app displays information about the positions of the Sun and planets, both in the sky and relative
                to each other. The app can produce thirteen pages, which can be selected using the three-dot menu in
                the upper right corner.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="planet-transits">Planet Transits</h2>
        <p>
            The default page is the Planet Transits page, which shows the times of sunset, sunrise and twilight
            as well as the rising, transit, and setting times of the planets. The times of the four major Moon phases,
            new, 1<sup>st</sup> quarter, full, and last quarter are also shown. The page has two time axes. The vertical
            axis is time running from the current time (at the page’s bottom) upwards through the next year (at the
            page’s top).
        </p>
        <p>
            The horizontal axis is the local standard time (i.e., standard time; daylight saving time is not used anywhere in the app) within each day. The curved white line on the left side shows the time of sunset. The blue region to the left of that line shows the time of evening
            twilight. The white curve on the right-hand side shows the time of sunrise, with morning twilight shown to its
            left in blue, and the phase of the Moon shown to the right of the curve. The latitude, longitude, Universal Time,
            and Local Sidereal Time are shown above the graphic plot.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the current time and the phone’s location are used to produce the page, but user-defined values
            can be entered using dialog boxes selectable in the three-dot menu. Horizontal gray lines are drawn between sunset
            and sunrise for day 1 of each month. If the current time is between sunset and sunrise, it is shown as a vertical
            gray line running through all displayed days.
        </p>
        <p>
            The times of rising, transit, and setting for each planet are plotted between the sunset and sunrise curves. The colors used are:
            Mercury: gray; Venus: white; Mars: red; Jupiter: orange; Saturn: yellow; Uranus: blue-green; and Neptune: blue.
            The transit lines are bright, and the rising and setting lines are dimmer. Planet symbols are shown near the lines,
            with r, t, and s subscripts for rise, transit, and set.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lines are only plotted for times between sunset and sunrise, so for most locations no transit lines for Mercury
            or Venus are plotted, and for those planets the rise and set lines are bright.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="planet-elevations">Planet Elevations</h2>
        <p>
	  This page shows the elevation above the horizon for the Sun, Moon and planets for a single day. The UT or standard time is listed across the top, and the LST is listed across the bottom. The vertical lines show the time of sunset (left) and sunrise (right), along with blue shading for twilight. A horizontal line for each object shows the period of time during which the object is above the horizon. Tick marks on those lines show the elevation at 20° intervals, and a tick mark at the line's center shows the object's elevation at transit. A vertical line (gray before sunset, green after sunset) shows the current time. The current elevation of each object is shown at the intersection of the current time line and the object's horizontal line. The names of the objects that are currently visible are shown in green. The Moon is treated as "day-visible" when its illuminated fraction is ≥ 25%.
	  </p>
	<p>
	  On this page only, the display switches to the next day after sunrise. The individual object tracks are updated immediately after the object sets, so once the object sets the track for the next day is plotted (which is really only noticeably different for the Moon).
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="planet-compass">Planet Compass</h2>
        <p>
	  This page shows the current azimuth and elevation of the Sun, Moon and planets.  The full circle on the upper right shows the azimuth of each object. Objects above the horizon are shown in white, and objects below the horizon are red. The lengths of the lines connecting the circle to the object's symbol are meaningless - different lengths are used merely to prevent the symbols from overlapping. The semicircle on the upper left shows the current elevation for each object.
	</p>
	<p>
	 Below the graphic figures is a table of the hour angle and rising, transit and setting times for all the plotted objects.  Objects above the horizon are named with green text, and red otherwise. The time of the next event for each object is shown in white, and the other events are shown in gray. Event times which fall in the next day are marked with an asterisk.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="planet-phenomena">Planet Phenomena</h2>
        <p>
	  The Planet Phenomena page shows a table with the date and time (to the nearest hour) of certain events related to a planet's position in the sky. The table has two columns: the left column shows the time of the most recent occurrence of the phenomenon, and the right column shows when the phenomenon will next occur.
	</p>
	<p>
	For the inferior planets (Mercury and Venus) the dates and hour of inferior conjunction (when the object is directly between the Sun and the Earth), maximum western elongation (from the Sun, with the angular separation), superior conjunction (when the object is directly behind the Sun as seen from Earth) and maximum eastern elongation (with the angular separation) are shown. The maximum elongation times shown can be in error by up to three hours. These two planets (especially Mercury) are most easily seen near greatest elongation.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For the superior planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) the times of conjunction (when the Sun is between the Earth and the planet) and opposition (when the Earth is between the Sun and the planet) are listed.  The planet is usually impossible to see near conjunction, and best seen near opposition.
	</p>

        <hr>
        <h2 id="lunar-calendar">Lunar Calendar</h2>
        <p>
	  The Lunar Calendar shows the phase of the Moon for every day within a 21 month interval, centered on the current month.
	  You can swipe right or left to move forward or backward in time. Blue Moons (the second Full Moon in a calendar month) are shown in cyan.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A yellow square is drawn around the current phase. All Full Moons are circled in red. Light gray shading is applied to the unilluminated portion of the Moon figure if earthshine might be visible. New Moons are shown in dark gray.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="lunar-eclipses">Lunar Eclipses</h2>
        <p>
	  The Lunar Eclipse page will show you information about lunar eclipses within the time range of 1999 BC through 3000 AD. When you first select the page, you will be presented with a list of eclipses that occur during the current decade. The year range is listed near the top, and the "-" button moves you back one decade, and the "+" button moves you forward one decade. Below the decade indicator is a set of buttons that allow you to select the type of eclipses that should appear in the list. By default Partial and Total eclipses are shown, but not wimpy, "Why did I stay up for this?" penumbral eclipses. You can also set a filter to show only eclipses that are visible from your location. The list can be quite long, so it is scrollable.  Tap on the date of the eclipse you are interested in, to show the eclipse details.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The eclipse page provides information about the eclipse you selected. Below the date, the app tells you information about what portion of the eclipse is visible from your location. Below that line it tells you how many minutes of the various eclipse phases will be visible from your location.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Two diagrams are drawn on the page:
	</p>
	<a href="MoonPathDiagram.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
	  <img src="MoonPathDiagram.png" alt="Diagram of the Moon's path through the Earth's shadow" style="width: 95.0%; height: auto;"></a>
	<p>
	  The upper one shows the path of the Moon through the Earth's shadow. The umbra is dark gray, and the penumbra is light gray. Circles are drawn at different locations in the shadow, representing significant times within the eclipse. These times are labelled (with gray connecting arrows) above the diagram, along with the elevation if the Moon will be above the horizon at that time. Events that occur when the Moon is below the horizon are shown in gray. A few hours before the eclipse begins, a small image of the Moon will appear that will approach and move through the shadow as the eclipse takes place.
	</p>
	<a href="EclipseMap.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
	  <img src="EclipseMap.png" alt="Map of the Earth showing where the eclipse can be seen" style="width: 95.0%; height: auto;">
	  </a>
	<p>
	  The lower diagram shows the regions on the Earth where different phases of the eclipse can be seen. In the region shaded dark gray, the eclipse is not visible at all. The region shaded in medium gray only gets to see a penumbral eclipse. The region shaded light gray gets to see a partial eclipse, and the unshaded region gets to see a total eclipse. The observer's location is shown by a red dot, and the place on the Earth where the midpoint of the eclipse happens with the Moon directly overhead is shown by a blue dot.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The back button returns you to the eclipse selection list.
	</p>
        <hr>
	<h2 id="jovian-moons">Jovian Moons</h2>
	<p>
	  The Jovian Moons page shows the positions of the four Galilean Moons relative to Jupiter. The current configuration is shown at the top, and the positions throughout the current calendar month are shown below it. Gray lines are drawn at 00:00 UT for each day. The "Animate" button shows how the moons move throughout the month.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The buttons on the lower right allow you to invert (north down, appropriate for Newtonian telescopes) or mirror-reverse (appropriate for Schmidt-Cassegrain or some refracting telescopes) the page, to match the view seen with your telescope.
	</p>
        <hr>
	<h2 id="jovian-moon-events">Jovian Moon Events</h2>
	<p>
	  The Jovian Moon Events page shows a table of the start and stop times for eclipses (moon goes into Jupiter's shadow), occultations (moon goes behind Jupiter), transits (moon passes in front of Jupiter) and shadow transits (the moon's shadow falls on Jupiter's cloud deck). Events for the current and next UT day are shown, so some of the events listed may have already occurred; a check mark is shown after those events. Events for which Jupiter is above the horizon and the Sun is below the horizon are shown in green, except for the next one which is shown in red. Other events are shown in gray.
	</p>
        <hr>
	<h2 id="analemma">Analemma</h2>
	<p>
	  The Analemma is a plot of the
altitude of the Sun at transit, versus the Equation of Time for each
day of the year. Its primary purpose is to confuse students looking
at old globes. The value for the current time is shown with a dot
marked “Now”.
	</p>
        <hr>
	<h2 id="meteor-showers">Meteor Showers</h2>
	<p>
	  The Meteor Showers page shows data for this year's periodic meteor shower events.  The main utility of this page is that it looks at the Moon's position during the shower, and figures out whether or not the sky will be dark enough to see the meteors. It goes without saying that you should avoid light-polluted areas, but if the Moon is over the horizon even that will greatly reduce the number of meteors that you will see.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The Meteor Showers page shows information for all showers, the vast majority of which are really minor events. Even when a meteor shower is not occurring, you can expect to see 4 to 10 meteors per hour. Many of the showers listed don't even double that background rate, and are of interest only to serious meteor enthusiasts. If you just want to go out and see some meteors for fun, it's best to select a shower with a rate of at least 50 meteors per hour, and to watch it on or very near the date of the shower's maximum. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The page shows a table, with one row per shower. The first column lists the name of the shower. The second column lists the peak rate of meteors per hour. The third column shows the date range over which the shower occurs, in DD/MM format. The fourth column shows the date of the shower's peak intensity. The fifth column shows the average speed (in km/sec) of the meteors; higher speeds mean brighter, bluer meteors. The sixth column shows what fraction of the Moon is illuminated by sunlight on the shower's peak night; a trailing + means the Moon is waxing, a - means the Moon is waning. The last column shows the number of dark hours (Sun and Moon both well below the horizon) on the shower's peak night.  The number of dark hours is calculated from the time at which the Sun is at least 18 degrees below the horizon (end/beginning of astronomical twilight) and a model of the scattered moonlight brightness from <a href="https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1991PASP..103.1033K" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Krisciunas and Schaefer (1991)</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Rows are printed in green if the listed shower is currently occurring. Bright green is used if the Moon is not interfering with shower viewing, dark green is used otherwise. Showers that are not currently occurring are listed in white if there will be more than 2 hours of darkness on the shower's peak night, and gray otherwise.  The number of dark hours for the next or current night is shown at the bottom of the page.
	</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="schematic-orrery">Schematic Orrery</h2>
        <p>
            The Schematic Orrery page shows the current position of the planets (and our Moon) relative to the Sun, as seen
            from above the Sun’s north pole, with the top of the page oriented towards the Vernal Equinox. Nothing is to
            scale, and the orbits are shown as circles, not ellipses. This page gives a rough idea of where Solar System objects are at
            the moment. Buttons at the bottom of the page allow the planetary motions to be animated over a period of 1, 10,
            or 100 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The longer periods are animated more rapidly, so that all three animations run for about the same elapsed time.
            While animations are running, they can be stopped by pressing the STOP button. Pressing the Reset Time button returns
            the page to the initial time.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="to-scale-orrery">To-scale Orrery</h2>
        <p>
            The To-scale Orrery page is like the Schematic Orrery, except that the planet orbits are shown, to scale, as
            properly oriented ellipses with the Sun at one focus. Because the orbits of the inner planets are so small relative
            to Neptune’s orbit, pinch-to-zoom must be used to see all of the orbits distinctly. Halley's Comet is included, because it has an interesting highly eccentric retrograde orbit.
        </p>
	<hr>
	<h2 id="astronomical-times">Astronomical Times</h2>
	<p>
	  The Astronomical Times page displays several different times useful in astronomy:<br>
	  <b>JD</b>: This is the Julian
Day, a count of the number of days since January 1, 4713 BC (Julian proleptic calendar). This
timescale is used to assign unambiguous dates to astronomical events
throughout recorded history, so that we don’t have to worry about
what particular calendar was used at some date in the past. A historical convention is that the Julian Day changes at noon UT, not at midnight, perhaps because European astronomers didn’t want the day to change in the middle of a night’s observations.<br>
	  <b>MJD:</b> JD-2400000.5<br>
	  <b>UT:</b> The Universal Time<br>
	  <b>Eq. of Time:</b> The Equation of Time, the difference between apparent time (sundial time) and mean time. Mean Time = Apparent Time - Eq. of Time<br>
	  <b>Eq. of Equinoxes:</b> The Equation of the Equinoxes, the difference between the apparent sidereal time and the mean sidereal time. AST = MST + EqEq<br>
<b>Mean Solar:</b> The local time using a “mean fictitious Sun” that moves in such a way as to produce days of exactly equal length.<br>
<b>App. Solar:</b> The local time using the real Sun.<br>
<b>Mean LST:</b> The Local Sidereal Time using uniform length days.<br>
<b>App. LST:</b> The Apparent Sidereal Time<br>

	<h2 id="a-note-on-coordinates">A note on coordinates</h2>
	<p>
	  The sky coordinates used by this app are derived from the JPL Horizons ephemeris, for the years 2021 through 2031. Outside of that range, orbital elements are used to produce coordinate estimates. This is done to prevent the stored ephemeris values from consuming too much storage space.
	</p>
        <hr>
	<h2 id="when-do-things-update">When do things update?</h2>
	<p>
	  On the Planet Elevations and Planet Compass pages, the values for each object are updated immediately after the object has set. This means, for example, when an object rises, the rise time is not immediately changed to the time that it will next rise. The same is true for transit. Once the object sets, then the rising, transiting and setting times will all be recalculated together for the next time that the object will cross the sky.
